# METS 1.x

This repository holds the current METS 1.x schema, [version 1.12.1](https://github.com/mets/METS-schema/blob/master/mets.xsd). The history of the schema is represented in the commit log.

Current effort from the METS editorial board is focused on the draft METS 2.x schema, but METS 1.x will continue to be available and maintained as necessary for existing uses.

# METS 2.x

This repository also holds [the draft METS 2.x schema](https://github.com/mets/METS-schema/blob/mets2/v2/mets.xsd).

There is also a [detailed description of the proposed changes](https://github.com/mets/METS-schema/blob/mets2/METS2.md) along with fully-worked examples of METS 2 documents.

METS 2 simplifies the schema, makes it more consistent, and removes reliance on the outdated XLink standard. It aims to retain a clear path for migration from METS 1 for most use cases.
