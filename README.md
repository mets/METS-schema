# METS 2.x

This repository holds [the METS 2.x schema](https://github.com/mets/METS-schema/blob/main/v2/mets.xsd).

There is also a [detailed description of the proposed changes](https://github.com/mets/METS-schema/blob/main/METS2.md) along with [fully-worked examples](https://github.com/mets/METS-schema/tree/main/v2/examples) of migrating METS 1 to METS 2.

METS 2 simplifies the schema, makes it more consistent, and removes reliance on the outdated XLink standard. It aims to retain a clear path for migration from METS 1 for most use cases.

Additional resources are available for METS 2.x at [mets.github.io](https://mets.github.io/)

# METS 1.x

This repository also holds the METS 1.x schema, [version 1.12.1](https://github.com/mets/METS-schema/blob/main/mets.xsd). The history of the schema is represented in the commit log.

Current effort from the METS editorial board is focused on the METS 2.x schema, but METS 1.x will continue to be available and maintained as necessary for existing uses.
